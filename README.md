# Explore Unexplored Reliable Samples to Enhance Test-Time Adaptation


This is the official implementation of [Explore Unexplored Reliable Samples to Enhance Test-Time Adaptation]

This implementation is based on [DeYO implementation ðŸ”—](https://github.com/mr-eggplant/SAR).

## Environments  
You should modify [username] and [env_name] in environment.yaml, then  
> $ conda env create --file environment.yaml

## Dataset
You can download ImageNet-C from a link [ImageNet-C ðŸ”—](https://zenodo.org/record/2235448).  
After downloading the dataset, move to the root directory ([data_root]) of datasets.  
Your [data_root] will be as follows:
```bash
data_root
â”œâ”€â”€ ImageNet-C
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ brightness
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ contrast
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
```
## Experiment

You can run most of the experiments in our paper by  
shell: python main.py

Moreover, we also prepare code for the plug-and-play, check the tentPOEM-I tentPOEM-II, and tentPOEM in methods filepackage.
